Each input graph should have the following format:

In the first line :"p n m r"
 n is the number of vertices.
 m is the number of edges  
 r is the root vertex usually we put 1
 
In the next lines we declare each directed edge in each line by two numbers: x y.
x is the source vertex .
y the destinated vertex.
The vertices should be numbered from 1 to n


To compile the code: g++ -O4 file_name.cpp
To run the code: ./a.out input_file
